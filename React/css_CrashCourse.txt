1st step : 

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,body{
    width:100%;
    height:100%;

}

selector{
    #id,tag,.class
}

pix : small values 
percentage : when u dont know the actual size according to window

margin : space between two elements 
padding : space within element, element ke andar


background-image: url(enter url);
background-size: cover // means image will be covered according to windows size
background-positions: center,top, bottom, etc 


//absolute 
means it comes up and all element may cover that specif space acoording top element number 
example car 

//who will be highest level will determine which one should cover 


//relative 
making elements's space relative means it is fixed even if it is absolute can move accoding to the 
give space but not outside the space 
// again absolute means it will pop up and display
it may cover others element 
or may shifts others elements 

//flexbox

lets say 3 elements are placed on box 
default placement should be top bottom 
but u want to display horizontally

so make that parent or reference as flex 
for width changes use justify contents 
for height chnages use align items
