// why react

React.js was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at
Facebook, in 2010. Initially, it was an internal prototype called
“FaxJS” built to solve a specific problem Facebook was facing:
updating the News Feed in real-time without requiring a full page refresh.


Efficient Rendering: React aimed to provide a more efficient way
of rendering dynamic user interfaces, allowing for faster and smoother updates.

Simplified View Logic: By unifying markup with view logic, React
made it easier to extend and maintain views, reducing the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.

JSX Syntax: React introduced JSX, an optional syntax extension,
to provide a readable and HTML-like syntax for building UI components.

React was designed for “innovators” rather than “early adopters,”
recognizing that the initial audience might be skeptical. To address
this, Facebook launched a “React tour” to convert skeptics into advocates


//calling element from other element 
const name = data.present?.name ;
recommended safely calling 


//const person1={
    name:"alice",
    age:30
}
const person2 = person1;
person2.age= person1.age + 1;

console.log(person1.age);
console.log(person2.age);

this will print 31 and 31

becuz both variable refers to same obj so changing variable 2 will result change in variable 1 
to avoid we use shallow copy 

const person1 = {
    name: "alice",
    age: 30
};
const person2 = { ...person1 }; // Create a shallow copy of person1
person2.age = person1.age + 1;

console.log(person1.age); // Outputs: 30
console.log(person2.age); // Outputs: 31
